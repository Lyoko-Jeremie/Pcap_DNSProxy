Common Problem

This document contains a set of common methods for dealing with the problem, 
when the tool can not be used normally can refer to this document to find a solution

-------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------


* WinPcap could not be installed over older version, so older versions must be uninstalled:

  * Simple Option / Run the WinPCap Uninstaller if available
    To install and uninstall WinPCap, find WinPCap in the Programs menu or search the directories for the uninstaller.

  * Find WinPcap uninstaller
        on WIN64 systems - \% PROGRAMFILES (x86)% (64-bit system) 
        on WIN32 systems - \% PROGRAMFILES% (32-bit system) 

  * If you can not find the uninstaller, you may need to enter the safe mode to remove all WinPcap files by hand  
    These files are 
        *% WINDIR% \ system32 \ Packet.dll
        *% WINDIR% \ system32 \ drivers \ npf.sys
        *% WINDIR% \ system32 \ WanPacket.dll
        *% WINDIR% \ system32 \ wpcap.dll
        *% WINDIR% \ system32 \ pthreadVC.dll

* If a message "Service does not respond in time to start or control request" appears when installing, running, or restarting services:
  * Service does not respond in time to start or control request - check for error report generation, see below for details Error.log Detailed Error Report section
  * Please check if there is an error report generated. For details, see the following section. Error.log Detailed Error Report Section

* Debug mode
  * When there is any suspected program is not working properly or error situation, you can bypass the service control program directly using the debug mode debug mode, all errors will be directly output to the screen
  * Terminate all running instances and determine that only one program is running at the same time
  * Windows
    * Run directly with administrator permission

* If the following results occur, the service is not running successfully or the setting error, please check whether there is an error report generated, or move the ReadMe document in the installation method section

   > Nslookup www.google.com
    ..
    Server: UnKnown
    Address: :: 1 (depending on the network environment, 127.0.0.1 when the local listening protocol is IPv4)

    *** UnKnown not found www.google.com: No response from server


-------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------


* If the following results occur, the service is running successfully but the remote DNS server does not respond, check for error report generation
  * Be sure to set up a correct, valid, and usable offshore DNS server
  * This may be a problem with the network. Part of the ISP / operator to UDP protocol forwarding packet loss rate is relatively high, you can try to switch to the TCP protocol mode (see ReadMe document configuration parameters in the detailed description of the base base area of ​​the Operation Mode section) or try to request several times
  * May also be due to a long time running a cumulative error caused by the task force is trying to solve. You can try to restart the service (see the restart service in the ReadMe documentation)

   > Nslookup www.google.com
    Server: pcap-dnsproxy.server (depending on the value of the profile settings, see the details of the profile in the ReadMe documentation)
    Address: :: 1 (depending on the network environment, 127.0.0.1 when the local listening protocol is IPv4)

    DNS request timed out.
        Timeout was 2 seconds.
    DNS request timed out.
        Timeout was 2 seconds.
    DNS request timed out.
        Timeout was 2 seconds.
    DNS request timed out.
        Timeout was 2 seconds.
    *** request pcap-dnsproxy.server timeout (depending on the value set by the profile, see the details of the configuration file in the ReadMe document)

   > Nslookup -vc www.google.com
    Server: pcap-dnsproxy.server (depending on the value of the profile settings, see the details of the profile in the ReadMe documentation)
    Address: :: 1 (depending on the network environment, 127.0.0.1 when the local listening protocol is IPv4)

    *** There is no internal type for both IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses (A + AAAA) records that www.google.com can use
